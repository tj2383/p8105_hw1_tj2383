Question 1: I created a data frame (q1\_df) comprised of:

-A random sample (random\_samp) of size 10 from a uniform\[0, 5\] distribution -A logical vector (logical\_vec) indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 2 -A (length-10) character vector (character\_vec) -A (length-10) factor vector (factor\_vec)

``` r
set.seed(168)
q1_df = tibble(
  random_samp = runif(10, min = 0, max = 5),
  logical_vec = random_samp > 2,
  character_vec = c("dog", "cat", "rabbit", "frog", "mouse", "rat", "fly", "hippo", "horse", "bird"),
  factor_vec = factor(c("low", "medium", "high", "medium", "low", "medium", "high", "low", "low", "high"))
)
```

I computed means for the random sample, the logical vector, the character vector, and the factor vector.

``` r
mean(q1_df$random_samp)
```

    ## [1] 3.199192

``` r
mean(q1_df$logical_vec)
```

    ## [1] 0.7

``` r
mean(q1_df$character_vec)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(q1_df$character_vec): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(q1_df$factor_vec)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(q1_df$factor_vec): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
## The mean can not be computed for the character, and factoral variables because the values are not numeric/integers. The mean was calculated for the random_samp of uniform distribution and the logical_vec.
```

I attempted to convert the logical, character, and factor vectors to numeric vectors.

``` r
as.numeric(q1_df$logical_vec),
as.numeric(q1_df$character_vec),
as.numeric(q1_df$factor_vec)

## The as.numeric function converts character values to numeric values. In the logical vector, 0 is FALSE and 1 is TRUE. In the factor vector, 2 is Low, 3 is Medium, and 1 is High. Numeric values cannot be assigned to a character variable.
```

I converted character\_vec to a factor vector (new\_factorvec). Then converted new\_factorvec to a numeric vector. I converted factor\_vec to a character vector (new\_charvec). Then converted new\_charvec to a numeric vector.

``` r
new_factorvec = as.factor(q1_df$character_vec)
as.numeric(new_factorvec)
```

    ##  [1]  3  2  9  5  8 10  4  6  7  1

``` r
## Since each character variable is unique it attempted to create 10 levels when converting to the factor (categorical) variables. Assigned random numbers to the 10 level factor (categorical) variable.

new_charvec = as.character(q1_df$factor_vec)
as.numeric(new_charvec)
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

    ##  [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

``` r
# Converted the factor (categorical) variables to just character variables, as in, did not distinguish the levels. But could not convert from character to nueric because those numeric/integer values cannot be assigned to character variables.
```

Question 2: I created a data frame (q2\_df) comprised of: x: a random sample of size 1000 from a standard Normal distribution y: a random sample of size 1000 from a standard Normal distribution A logical vector (sum\_vec) indicating whether the x + y &gt; 0 A numeric vector (num\_sumvec) created by coercing the above logical vector A factor vector (fac\_sumvec) created by coercing the above logical vector

``` r
set.seed(168)
q2_df = tibble(
  x = rnorm(1000),
  y = rnorm(1000),
  sum_vec = (x + y) > 0,
  num_sumvec = as.numeric(sum_vec),
  fac_sumvec = as.factor(num_sumvec)
)
```

The size of the dataset is 1000. The mean of x is 0.0016161 and the median of x is -0.0100357. The proportion of cases for which the logic vector is "TRUE" is 0.496

I made a scatterplot of y vs. x using the logical, numeric, and factor variables from the previous part. Then I exported the plot of the logical variable to my project directory.

``` r
logic_plot = ggplot(q2_df, aes(x = x, y = y, color = sum_vec)) + geom_point()
num_plot = ggplot(q2_df, aes(x = x, y = y, color = num_sumvec)) + geom_point()
fac_plot = ggplot(q2_df, aes(x = x, y = y, color = fac_sumvec)) + geom_point()

## The color scale of the logical vector and the factor vector are the same, red for FALSE or 0 and blue for TRUE or 1. The color scale of the numeric vector is a gradient that represents the different numeric values with different shades of blue.

ggsave("logic_scatterplot.pdf", plot = logic_plot)
```
